1. Explanation of What Happens Without Handling Exceptions
If the exceptions thrown by the play() methods of Media objects are not handled:
- The program will terminate abruptly when an exception is thrown.
- The stack trace will be printed to the console, and no meaningful message will be shown to the user.
- Any subsequent code after the exception will not execute.
